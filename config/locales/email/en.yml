            Thank you for using Rock the Vote’s tool to request your absentee ballot for an election in 2021!  Your request form was emailed to your election official:
            <br/><br/>
            %{elections_office_name}
            <br/><br/>
            If you have questions or concerns, you can check the status of your absentee request online at %{status_check_url}, or by calling %{status_check_phone}.

            <br/><br/>
            Once your ballot arrives, make sure to read the instructions carefully, complete your ballot and send it back as soon as you can. If you’re planning to return your completed ballot in the mail, be sure to allow enough time for your ballot to make it back to your election official. If we want politicians to pay attention to the issues we care about, we have to vote!
