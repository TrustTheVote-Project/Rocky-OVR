        <p>Dear County Clerk & Recorder:</p>
        <p>Hello, my name is Mike Dean and I am the Executive Director of LeadMN, 
        a non-partisan, non-profit organization representing the 180,000 two-year 
        college students in Minnesota. The attached voter registration application 
        was collected in partnership with Rock the Vote’s online voter registration 
        assistance platform, which prompted the individual who was registering to 
        input their personal information and signature in the official National Mail 
        Voter Registration form. We have worked closely with the Secretary of State’s 
        office to make sure we follow Minnesota voter registration drive rules and timelines.</p>
        <p>To ensure compliance, we will always submit registration forms with the information 
        exactly as it was completed by the registrant. LeadMN and Rock the Vote do not in any 
        form alter the information submitted, as agreed in a meeting with the Secretary of 
        State’s office.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to contact the​ LeadMN team at 
        <a href="mailto:info@leadmn.org">info@leadmn.org</a> or by phone at 
        651-297-5877 with any questions regarding this form or our process. For any technical 
        questions related to Rock the Vote or its registration assistance platform, please feel 
        free to include Melissa Wyatt, Director of Civic Technology at Rock the Vote in any 
        outreach: <a href="mailto:melissa@rockthevote.org">melissa@rockthevote.org</a>.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,<br/><br/>

        Mike Dean<br/>Executive Director<br/>LeadMN
