          sign an ID Confirmation Statement at the polls. Voters arriving at the polls 
          without an acceptable form of ID will be required to either sign an ID Confirmation 
          Statement or vote a provisional ballot.  If a voter votes a provisional ballot, 
          they will have until noon on the Friday following the election to deliver a copy 
          of identification to their locality’s electoral board or sign an ID Confirmation 
          Statement in order for their provisional ballot to be counted. Virginia’s ID 
          requirements also apply to early voters who vote at the General Registrar's 
          Office or at a satellite voting location.
          </p>
          <p>
          Acceptable forms of identification for voting at the polling place or voting early include the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Voter confirmation documents you received after you registered to vote</li>
            <li>Virginia DMV-issued Driver’s License or Identification Card</li>
            <li>Valid United States Passport</li>
            <li>Any ID card issued by the US, Virginia, or a local Virginia government</li>
            <li>Any student ID card issued by a US university or community college</li>
            <li>Valid student ID issued by a public school or private school in Virginia</li>
            <li>Employer-issued photo ID card</li>
            <li>Any current utility bill, bank statement, government check,

          Don’t have one of these forms of ID? Any registered voter who does not possess one of the above mentioned forms of ID, may sign an ID Confirmation Statement.
